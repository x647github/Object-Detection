# Object Detection with EfficientDet

This project used the EfficientDet 04 model for object detection. The EfficientDet class of object detection models that were trained on the [COCO 2017 dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home). The different models in the family, ranging from D0 to D7, vary in terms of complexity and input image dimensions.
